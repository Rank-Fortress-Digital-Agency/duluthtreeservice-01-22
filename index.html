            <h2>Safety First</h2>
            <p>If you have a diseased or damaged tree, it needs to be removed immediately. Some diseases and damage can spread very quickly, so you must contact a professional tree service immediately if your tree shows signs of being unhealthy. However, even trees that appear healthy may need the expertise of a professional tree care service for preventive care. Old, dead, or diseased branches pose hazards for anyone living near the tree. Diseased trees may also lose limbs quickly without warning, which can lead to damage to your property. A professional tree service will not only help eliminate the hazards of diseased or damaged trees, but they can also prune unhealthy branches that are poised to fall at any moment.</p>

            <h2>Property Value</h2>
            <p>Keeping your trees healthy and beautiful is a great way to maintain the value of your home. Trees add both beauty and value to your property. If you have new trees planted by a professional tree service, this may increase the value of your home even more than if you had existing trees on your property. One very important thing to remember when trying to determine how much a new tree will increase the value of your property is that it isn’t just about what you paid for them, but rather how long they will last before needing replacement.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Convenience</h2>
            <p>If you have a busy life, it may be difficult to find the time to care for your trees. You might have a hectic schedule or work long hours. In either case, finding time to cut branches and rake leaves can be very difficult. Hiring a professional tree service will ensure that your property always looks beautiful with little or no effort from you at all. <a href="https://www.treeduluth.com/tree-trimming-cutting-service.html">Trimming</a> and <a href="https://www.treeduluth.com/tree-pruning-service/">pruning</a> are essential to the health of your trees. Without proper trimming, branches can grow too low or tall, which could pose a danger to you, your home, or even your neighbors. Proper trimming prevents this from happening. A professional tree company will know how much to trim each branch so that each tree always looks its best.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Peace of Mind</h2>
            <p>Having your trees cared for by an expert ensures that you always have healthy, beautiful trees. For many people, the peace of mind they get from knowing their tree care needs are met is worth much more than money. You can spend your time doing something other than worrying about hazardous trees and damage to your property. At Duluth Tree Service, our professional arborists provide several important services for homeowners. No matter what type of trees you have on your property or how much experience you have with them, we can help protect them and keep them healthy.</p>

            <h2>Protect Yourself</h2>
            <p>A professional tree service can help protect your family and home from storm damage. For example, if a tree falls during a storm and damages the power lines, the tree service company will pay for all costs to remove and replace the tree as well as landscaping costs. This is especially important because homeowners insurance may not cover these types of damages. When you hire a professional tree service, they can also help ensure that you are covered in such situations by providing proof that they handled this type of work on your property.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Keep Your Lawn Green</h2>
            <p>If you have a lot of trees on your property, especially tall ones, it can be difficult to keep the lawn green under the branches. A professional tree service will help ensure that water can reach all areas of your lawn so you have a beautiful yard without having to hire an expensive landscaper. Professional tree services can perform a wide range of tasks to help you care for your trees. Allowing a professional arborist to work on your trees will ensure that the job is done correctly and if something goes wrong, it will be somebody else’s problem. You can expect regular consultations with an arborist in order for them to provide you with an expert opinion about your trees, let you know what damage has been done and how it can be treated, and give regular updates on tree growth and necessary maintenance.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Immediate Response</h2>
            <p>If there is ever an emergency involving your trees or damage due to storm damage, it’s important to have an immediate response from a professional tree service. Most people include such emergencies as part of their regular contract with a tree care company as well as provide them access to the property if necessary. This ensures that any necessary work gets done quickly and safely after a storm for example. Although many companies do provide emergency responses, it is important to be sure that your company of choice does.</p>

                    <h2>Choose the Right Company</h2>
                    <p>There are many types of tree care companies available at varying costs. A professional, insured company with a reputation for excellent service is typically the best choice. They will have employees with extensive knowledge who can provide you with references from previous clients as well as work they have done for other property owners in your area if you ask them to do so. This ensures that you are getting quality advice and workmanship that will last long into the future. Check out the company to make sure they are licensed and insured. Ask them for regular references from satisfied customers who live in your area, not from their hometown or other regions where tree care might be performed differently. Be wary of companies that spend a lot on advertising as this is a red flag that they don’t rely on satisfied customers for word-of-mouth referrals.</p>
